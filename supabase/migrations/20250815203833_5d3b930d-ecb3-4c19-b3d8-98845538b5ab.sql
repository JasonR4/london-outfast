We prove them.\n\n• **Original media-owner invoices** are uploaded to your secure client portal.\n• **You see the exact net cost** we''re billed, side-by-side with our commission.\n• **The rate you pay is the rate we pay**—no hidden uplifts, no opaque margins.\n• **If someone quotes you lower**, we''ll match or beat it—or show you why the site/loop share differs.\n\nThe result? Trust + value. Your budget goes further, your board has confidence, and campaigns move faster because approvals are easier when everything''s visible.\n\n## What a great London OOH brief looks like\n\n• **Objective**: awareness / response / store opens / event / B2B\n• **Audience**: who + where (boroughs/commutes/POIs)\n• **Timing**: dates, crucial moments, sensitivity to seasonality\n• **Geography**: London-wide vs corridors vs boroughs\n• **Budget & flexibility**: target range + what''s movable (dates/formats)\n• **Creative**: static vs motion, dynamic data needs, production approach\n• **Measurement**: what \"good\" looks like (reach, footfall, search, sales)\n\n[Send it via /brief](/brief) and we''ll translate into a plan within hours.\n\n## Typical timelines (fast-track available)\n\n• **Scope & plan**: 24–72 hours (often faster for repeats)\n• **Booking & approvals**: 1–5 days (availability led)\n• **Production**: 3–14 working days (digital vs classic)\n• **Live**: from same week on digital to 2–3 weeks for classic/specials\n\n## Indicative London OOH \"starter\" packages\n\n• **City-wide awareness (2 weeks)**: blended D6 + D48 + Underground 6-sheets for mass reach.\n• **Borough domination**: focused D6, bus sides, local banners, community formats.\n• **Premium fame burst**: XTP, station gateways, spectacular D48, Westfield full-motion.\n• **Performance layer**: pDOOH overlays with audience/POI triggers + live optimisation.\n\nWe''ll model multiple options and show expected reach/frequency and effective CPM so you can compare apples with apples.\n\n## FAQs\n\n**How much should I budget for London OOH?**\n\nBudgets vary widely. Effective \"starter\" bursts can begin in the low five figures; city-wide fame campaigns scale to six/seven figures. We''ll shape a plan that maximises effective CPM and real-world outcomes for your spend.\n\n**Is programmatic cheaper?**\n\nIt''s more flexible, not automatically cheaper. The value is in dayparting, triggers, flighting and optimisation—great for performance-oriented briefs and testing.\n\n**How quickly can we go live?**\n\nDigital can deploy within days once creative is approved. Classic formats need print + posting time. We fast-track when the estate allows.\n\n**Can you guarantee station ownerships or specific roads?**\n\nWe''ll request and negotiate your wish-list and present real alternatives where availability is tight—always with transparent pricing.\n\n**How do you prove results?**\n\nWe offer reach curves, footfall uplift, promo code tracking, MMM inputs and brand-lift options—matched to your KPIs.\n\n## Ready to plan London OOH?\n\nUse the [Smart Quote Builder](/quote) to explore formats and get live pricing, or [send your brief](/brief) and we''ll return a plan the same day (business hours).
