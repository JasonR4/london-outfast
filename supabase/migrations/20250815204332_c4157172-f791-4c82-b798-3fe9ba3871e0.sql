<h2>The Transparent Invoicing difference</h2>

<p>Lots of agencies talk about "great rates". We prove them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original media-owner invoices</strong> are uploaded to your secure client portal.</li>
<li><strong>You see the exact net cost</strong> we''re billed, side-by-side with our commission.</li>
<li><strong>The rate you pay is the rate we pay</strong>—no hidden uplifts, no opaque margins.</li>
<li><strong>If someone quotes you lower</strong>, we''ll match or beat it—or show you why the site/loop share differs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result? Trust + value. Your budget goes further, your board has confidence, and campaigns move faster because approvals are easier when everything''s visible.</p>
